Alright, you've got **yayc** in one way or another! Now just launch it, open the
settings to specify the working directories where to save the history, bookmarks
and chromium profile, and then you are good to go!

YAYC stores bookmarks as one file per video, and categories as subdirectories.
This is a simple, efficient and portable way that also allows easy backup as well as
processing through 3rd party tools.

Below some screens illustrating the process

Note that: 
- If no bookmarks directory is specified, bookmarks won't be saved.
- If no history directory is specified, history won't be saved.
- If no Google profile directory is specified, YAYC will operate in Incognito mode, and logging into your Google account won't be remembered at next app restart.
